Great—here’s a clear walkthrough of what each block does and why, so you can explain it confidently.

What the inputs look like

panel: one row per auction × date in a ±10-trading-day window.
Columns you use here:
auction_dt, series_id, date, rel_day (−10…+10), y_close (yield %), asw (%), curve_resid (%), bucket, maturity_year.

Everything below derives from that table.

1) Build “concession by horizon” in a wide format

Function: concessions_wide(panel, metric=..., baseline_rel=-5, pre_days=[8..1], fwd_days=[0..5], in_bp=True)

Goal: for each auction, compute concession at multiple horizons (P8…P1, T, F1…F5) and return one row per auction with one column per horizon.

How it works

Filter panel to the horizons you care about (e.g., −8…+5).

Compute a baseline per auction at rel_day = baseline_rel (default T−5):

base = panel[(rel_day==-5)].groupby(auction).mean(metric)


Concession for each row = metric − base (e.g., yield level minus its T−5 level).
If in_bp=True multiply by 100 to express in basis points.

Pivot to wide form: columns become the relative day.

Rename columns: -8→P8, …, -1→P1, 0→T, +1→F1, …, +5→F5.

Merge the auction’s bucket (Short/Mid/Long) for later grouping.

Result: a DataFrame like

auction_dt | series_id | P8 | ... | P1 | T | F1 | ... | F5 | bucket


You can run this for metric="y_close" (outright), "asw", or "curve_resid".

2) Compute pairwise correlations between pre and forward horizons

Function: corr_pre_vs_forward(wide_df, min_periods=8)

Goal: create a matrix where rows are pre horizons (P8…P1) and columns are forward horizons (T, F1…F5). Each cell is the correlation across auctions between, say, P3 concession and F2 concession.

How it works

Identify pre_cols = [P8..P1] and fwd_cols = ["T","F1"..].

For each (pre, fwd) pair:

Take the two columns, drop rows with NaNs in either, and if at least min_periods auctions remain, compute corr(), else set NaN.

Return a DataFrame indexed by pre_cols with columns fwd_cols.

This tells you:

Carry: positive correlation (pre concession tends to persist into/after the auction).

Mean-reversion: negative correlation (pre concession tends to unwind).

3) “Creative” visualisations of that correlation (no heatmap)
A) Correlation fan

Function: plot_corr_fan(pre_fwd_corr, title=...)

What it shows:
For each pre horizon (one line per P-k), plot its correlation against T, F1…F5. It annotates the strongest absolute correlation on each line.

How it works

x = forward horizons; y = that pre row’s values.

Skips lines that are all NaN; annotates the largest |corr| if any finite values exist.

Horizontal 0-line for reference; y-limits [−1, +1].

Why traders like it: you see at a glance which pre-days matter most, and when the effect shows up (T vs F1..F5).

B) Bipartite correlation network

Function: plot_corr_bipartite(pre_fwd_corr, title=..., threshold=0.2)

What it shows:
Left nodes = P8..P1, right nodes = T,F1..F5.
Edges drawn only where |corr| ≥ threshold.

Thickness ∝ |corr|

Color: blue = positive (carry), red = negative (reversal)

How it works

Builds a NetworkX graph with two partitions.

Places pre nodes at x=0, forward nodes at x=1 (simple left/right layout).

Draws weighted, signed edges.

Why it’s useful: highlights the strongest predictive links without a dense matrix.

4) Why you saw the “All-NaN slice” error and how the fix works

Originally, if a pre horizon (e.g., P8) had too few valid overlaps with forwards (not enough auctions with both P8 and, say, F3), its entire row in the correlation table could be NaN.

The fan plot tried to annotate the “max” on an all-NaN line → np.nanargmax error.

The fix:

corr_pre_vs_forward now requires min_periods per pair and writes NaN otherwise.

plot_corr_fan skips all-NaN lines and only annotates if any finite values exist.

5) How ASW and Curve concessions plug in

You already computed:

ASW per panel row: asw = y_close − swap(nearest tenor).

Curve residual per row: curve_resid = y_close − fitted_gilt_curve(ttm) where the curve is daily piecewise-linear on benchmark nodes.

To analyse them:

Call concessions_wide(panel, metric="asw") and/or metric="curve_resid" to get wide tables.

Feed those into corr_pre_vs_forward and the two plotting functions.

Same code → three different lenses (outright, vs swaps, vs curve).

6) Customisation knobs (you can explain these)

Baseline: change baseline_rel from −5 to −1 for a “day-before” definition.

Window: PRE_DAYS and FWD_DAYS control which horizons appear (start at P5 if P8 is sparse).

Units: in_bp=True puts concessions in bp. Ensure all inputs are in %.

Threshold (network): raise/lower to declutter/expand the graph.

min_periods (correlation): lower if your auction sample is small.

7) The story you can tell

Outright fan: Do pre concessions carry into T or fade? Does it differ for Short vs Long (run per bucket)?

ASW fan: Is carry stronger vs swaps than outright (liquidity vs macro)?

Curve fan: Are pre residuals mean-reverting (micro RV washout) or persistent?

Network: Which specific pre-horizons best explain T and F1..F5 outcomes?

That’s exactly the intent of the desk’s heatmap, but your visuals are more distinctive and presentation-friendly.

If you want, I can add a simple wrapper to compute and plot all three metrics (Outright/ASW/Curve) and both visuals per bucket in one go.
