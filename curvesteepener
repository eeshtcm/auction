1. Clarify the trading logic

Auctions inject net supply at a point on the curve (say, a new 10Y gilt).

Concession means that bond cheapens into supply.

Dealers hedge this duration by going short the auction tenor and long nearby maturities, which mechanically creates curve steepening or flattening flows.

👉 That’s why the trader suggested curve steepeners: you can try to front-run or fade these hedging flows.

2. Define the trade structure

Instead of just “curve steepening,” be precise:

For short auctions (2–5Y), the hedge flow tends to push 2s10s steeper.

For long auctions (20–30Y), the hedge flow can push 10s30s steeper.
So the trade is: “buy steepeners in the bucket being issued, hold around the auction, exit after supply clears.”

3. Test systematically

You’d want to backtest something like:

Entry: T−5 to T−1 (pre-auction).

Position: Receive front leg, pay back leg (steepener).

Exit: T+2 to T+5 (after supply absorbed).
Measure average P&L across auctions.

If you find systematic steepening around certain tenors, you can justify the trade.

4. Refine with conditioning

The raw idea may be too noisy. Refine by:

Auction size relative to market depth: bigger auctions should drive stronger steepening.

Net supply regime: effect should be larger in heavy QT years.

Curve regime: works best when the curve is flat and dealers are more duration-sensitive.

5. Position sizing & risk

Even if it works, the effect is small (a few bps).
So you’d:

Size based on historical volatility of 2s10s / 10s30s.

Cut quickly if macro data hits (e.g. CPI, BoE).

✅ Refined takeaway for presentation:
Instead of showing parallel concession/curve lines, frame it as:

“Because concession arises from hedging flows into the auction tenor, we tested whether it creates predictable steepening/flattening around auctions. The trade would be to enter curve steepeners in the auction bucket pre-supply, and unwind after absorption. Our next step is to condition this on auction size, tenor, and macro regime to see where it has positive expectancy.”
