Auction microstructure / mechanics

“If we separated auctions by tail size, do you think the concession dynamics look structurally different in small-tail vs. large-tail outcomes?”

“Would you expect green gilt auctions to exhibit a different concession pattern compared to nominals, given the more concentrated investor base?”

“Do concession correlations change depending on whether the auction falls right before a major macro event like CPI or MPC?”

“If I filtered out syndications and looked only at auctions, would you expect the concession persistence to strengthen, or do you think syndications contaminate the signal?”

 Curve vs. outright vs. ASW

“In your experience, is outright concession more predictive for client flow, while ASW concession tells you more about dealer positioning?”

“Do you think the curve measure should be done on-par with adjacent bonds, or fitted with the full spline? Would the choice affect concession persistence?”

“Sometimes ASW and outright concessions diverge. Do you see that as an arbitrage opportunity, or just a reflection of different hedging flows?”

“Which do you rely on more when preparing for supply — outright concession or swap spread concession?”

 Risk and positioning

“If these correlation fans show that pre-auction weakness usually persists into F1, should the desk lean more aggressively short ahead of auctions?”

“Would identifying when concession reverses quickly be a way to avoid getting squeezed post-auction?”

“How would you think about scaling trade sizes if the correlations are strong in shorts but weaker in longs?”

“If I added volatility weighting (so concessions are measured in standard deviations), would that make the signals more tradable in practice?”

Market regime dependence

“Would you expect concession persistence to strengthen when issuance is heavy (like in Q1) and weaken in lighter supply windows?”

“Do you think the persistence effect is regime-dependent — e.g., stronger when rates are rising vs. falling?”

“If I reran this analysis separately for risk-on vs. risk-off weeks, would you expect correlation patterns to flip?”

“Could the BOE’s QT schedule interact with concession patterns, amplifying or dampening them?”

 Practical application

“Would you actually run risk into the auction based on these concession metrics, or are they more useful as a post-mortem diagnostic?”

“How much of auction concession is about client behaviour vs. about primary dealers adjusting balance sheet?”

“Do you see a difference in concession stickiness when there’s strong GEMM participation vs. more buy-side take-up?”

“Could these results be used to design an intraday concession monitor, so traders can see when the pre-auction set-up is running away?”

 Big brain / “what if” questions

“What if I extended this framework to cross-market auctions — say Bund vs. Gilt supply — do you think the concessions are correlated?”

“Would you expect concession dynamics to be symmetric between auctions of shorts and ultras, or are the investor bases too different?”

“If I conditioned only on auctions that priced through secondary levels, would the correlation structure collapse?”

“Do you think concession persistence is partly self-fulfilling — i.e., because everyone watches it, they act on it, reinforcing the pattern?”
